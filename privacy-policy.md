## Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Calnetic collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Calnetic's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Calnetic's visitors use its website. From time to time, Calnetic may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Calnetic also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on [https://www.calnetic.com/](https://www.calnetic.com/) blog posts. Calnetic only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.

## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Calnetic's websites choose to interact with Calnetic in ways that require Calnetic to gather personally-identifying information.
